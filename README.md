# UCL-CSML-Notes
My lecture notes during times at UCL. Each of the folder contains a note for that subject: Most of them are transcription (and hopefully smaller) of the source material with some more details (such as additional prove not presented in the lecture), where we have:

- COMP0083: Advanced Topics in Machine Learning (`adv-topic-in-ml`)
- COMP0085: Approximate Inference and Learning in Probabilistic Models (`approx-infer`)
- COMP0086: Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning (`prob-unsup`)
- STAT0027: Foundation Fortnight (`rice-foundation-fortnight`)
- STAT0028: Statistical Models and Data Analysis (`stat-analysis`)
- COMP0078: Supervised Learning (`supervised-learning`)

In COMP0083, I also added some notes from [EE364a: Convex Optimization I](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) to refresh some of my memory for convex optimization. STAT0027, on the other hands, is wholly based on John A. Rice's [Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematical-Statistics-Data-Analysis-John/dp/0495110892). 

Currently it is a **draft** i.e poorly worded, direct copy, bad grammar etc. If there is any mistakes on my notes, feels free to make and issue and/or create a pull request.
